# CIFAR-image-classification-using-CNN

CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 image classification using Convolutional Neural Network (project for "Deep and Reinforcement Learning" course).

The Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files) were run in Google Colab Pro.

The Convolutional Neural Network has 6 convolutional layers.

CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data-sets contain 80 million color images of size 32 x 32 pixels each.
In CIFAR-10 data-set, images are classified in 10 categories (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck). 
In CIFAR-100 data-set, images are classified in 100 categories.
